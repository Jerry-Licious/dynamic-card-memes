Notice how judgment isn't a power card so it's really good against the awakened one. \nI really recommend the upgrade for the late game especially for the cultist kills. Even in single enemy fights it's really good, such as incrementing slow in giant head fight and going through intangible for nemesis. \nOverall it's a really generalists card, effective in almost all the fights, and it really shines in late game boss fights. \nNot only that, notice how it's a skill, so you can end your turn killing a minion with judgment and draw cards with sanctity next turn or activate crush joints to kill high health threats.
